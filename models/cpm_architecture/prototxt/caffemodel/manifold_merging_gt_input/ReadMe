Manifold layer is taking as input the gt and is forwarding it to the output.
Deploy file not there because there's no labels at test time.

Started from the model that has been initialised from model 50k where the weights multiplied by the manifold output are set to zero.

IMPORTANT: the architecture uses also relu layer for the last lasyers at each stage. DIFFERENT from what was done originally in the 50K model.
	   if I want to use this, change architecture.
