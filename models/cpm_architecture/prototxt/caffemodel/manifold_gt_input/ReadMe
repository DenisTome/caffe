Taking the model, randomly initialising the weights of the first Mconv layer in each stage and taking as input of the manifold the labels which are forwarded as output.

IMPORTAT: the orded of the element concateneted in the concat layer IS DIFFERENT: swapped pool with manifold. Therefore these weights are NOT directly usable if the architecture is not changed.
	  the architecture uses the RELU layers also on the last convolutional layers of each stage. If architecture does not, the weights are NOT directly usable.
